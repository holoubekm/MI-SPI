In the team of three we were assigned to use length of our representant's name as a parameter and generate distribution. Given this distribution we were told to accomplish several tasks:

* generate exponential distribution
* create a histogram of it
* create an empiric distribution function
* generate dataset with such a distribution and perform statistical tests
* generate another dataset of real data and perform another tests
* discuss quality of data


### Task 2
The second task was focused on the statistic t-tests, such as single side test, pair tests, etc

Results are written along the code.
